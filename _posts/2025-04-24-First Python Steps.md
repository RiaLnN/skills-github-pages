Today Iâ€™m writing my first blog post â€” pretty exciting!

Iâ€™ve recently started learning **Python**, and Iâ€™m already enjoying how clean and readable the language is.  
Coming from a **C++** background, I was used to more complex syntax and memory management. Python feels like a breath of fresh air in comparison.

So far, Iâ€™ve learned about:
- Variables and data types
- Loops and conditions
- Writing simple functions

Next up, I want to explore:
- Working with files
- Basic web scraping
- Maybe even some automation

This blog will be my place to share small discoveries, tips, and progress updates.  
Letâ€™s see where this Python journey goes ðŸš€
