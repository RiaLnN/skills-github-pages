# Welcome to My GitHub Page!

Hey there! 👋  
I'm currently learning **Python**, and I’ve already got a solid grip on **C++**.  
This page is my small corner of the internet where I’ll be experimenting and sharing cool stuff.

## 💻 What you'll find here:

- 🐍 Python mini-projects and scripts
- 💡 C++ tips and tricks I’ve learned
- 🔧 Coding experiments and notes

I'm just getting started, but stay tuned — there's more to come!

Thanks for stopping by 😊
